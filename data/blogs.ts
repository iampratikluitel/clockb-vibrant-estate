For those requiring financing, creative loan structures and relationship banking are becoming increasingly important. Despite the challenges, certain property sectors are demonstrating resilience, particularly those with strong inflation-hedging characteristics such as multifamily housing with short-term leases that allow for regular rent adjustments.",
